Powder Pixel Art
==============

A pixel art bot that draws a picture in the powder game (https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/) by reading a loaded image, converting the image to a specific color palette, and controlling the mouse to draw the image in the game. A useless tool, but fun to watch!

Important Information
__________________________________________________________________________

 - Do not touch your mouse or keyboard while the program draws!

 - You can stop the drawing process by pressing ESC at any time!
  
 - Make sure to refresh your Powder Game webpage before each drawing!

 - If the picture is not drawing correctly (e.g., pixel brush is too big, the simulation is running, weird lines
 streaking across picture), stop the drawing process and turn the delay up by 10 and try again. This changes the wait
 time between mouse clicks and movements.
